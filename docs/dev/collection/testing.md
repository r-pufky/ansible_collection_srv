# Collection Testing
Prerequisite:
* [ansible environment](../environment/ansible.md)

## Build and Install Local Collection
The collection must be built and installed locally to be tested.

Package built using semantic version from `galaxy.yml` and installed to local
collections cache
`~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/{USER}/{COLLECTION}`.

``` bash
ansible-galaxy collection build
ansible-galaxy collection install
```
* `--force`: force overwrite existing files (useful for repeated testing).

Collection **will** need to be rebuilt if changes (files or tests) were made.

## Running Tests
Alway [build and install](#build-and-install-local-collection) before running
tests.

``` bash
cd ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/{USER}/{COLLECTION}
ansible-test sanity
ansible-test integration
ansible-test units
```

## Troubleshooting

### Testing in roles uses old files
Collection cache is outdated. Clear the static collection cache to force
rebuild with update versions, or link to development repository.

Clear build cache:
``` bash
rm -rfv ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/r_pufky/srv
```

#### Development Testing
For rapid testing without rebuilding between tests; use a symlink to the fully
checked out collection. Only use on development machines. This will likely
cause issues later on.

``` bash
ln -s /var/git/ansible_collection_srv ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/r_pufky/srv
```
* Remove cached collection if needed
* `/var/venv/ansible_collection_srv/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/r_pufky/srv`
  may be removed as well.

Overrides the built collection with the currently development head. **Remove**
link before using production collections so the released version is installed.

#### External Testing
External playbooks (e.g. production, staging) can be tested against source
without building the collection. Any changes in the collection **require** the
changed roles to run `molecule create`; this will update the cached collection
location and enable those changes to be tested externally.

### Only Localhost is Available
Host inventory not detected when running collection tests.

``` bash
ansible-playbook roles/hello_motd/tests/playbook/test_hello_motd.yml
...
  [WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available
  [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match
  'all'
```

Explicitly specify inventory to use.

``` bash
ansible-playbook -i tests/inventory tests/playbook/test_hello_motd.yml
```

Typical host connection issues will occur - `--ask-become-pass` will be needed
if sudo used or use GPG key injection.

### Fixing GPLv3 License Missing
Community distributions assume GPLv3 and must be explicitly ignored if
different. An ignore file is required for each specific **version** of ansible.

``` bash
mkdir -p tests/sanity
touch tests/sanity/ignore-{ANSIBLE VERSION}.txt

touch tests/sanity/ignore-2.16.txt
```

**Order Matters**: if ignores are throwing warnings, check ordering and make
sure they are ordered correctly. Proper ignores will **not** generate warnings.

Only certain ignores are explicitly allowed; others will always throw
ansible-lint errors even if ignored.
