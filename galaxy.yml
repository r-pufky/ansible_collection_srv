# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories
# that should not be included in the build artifact. A pattern is matched from
# the relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory. This
# uses 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories. Some directories and files
# like 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry', and '.git' are always filtered.
#
# Mutually exclusive with 'manifest'.
