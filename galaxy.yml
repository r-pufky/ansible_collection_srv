# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories
# that should not be included in the build artifact. A pattern is matched from
# the relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory. This
# uses 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories. Some directories and files
# like 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry', and '.git' are always filtered.
#
# Mutually exclusive with 'manifest'
# A dict controlling use of manifest directives used in building the collection
# artifact. The key 'directives' is a list of MANIFEST.in style L(directives,https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-manifest-in/#manifest-in-commands).
# The key 'omit_default_directives' is a boolean that controls whether the
# default directives are used. Mutually exclusive with 'build_ignore'
# manifest: null
build_ignore:
  - 'test_archive_v1*'  # github testing archives.
